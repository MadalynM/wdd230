        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>Our Target Audience are small business owners and curious community members. We want business owners to join the chamber to help provide more connections and 
            support for them and the rest of the community. We also want consumers to be able to see the diverse amount of services that might be available to them locally.
        </p>

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>An owner of a small resturant heard about the chamber and wants to see what we have to offer. They're looking for how they would benefit from joining and how it
            will help their business specifically.
        </p>
        <p>A community member wants to support local Mom and Pop shops in their area, but aren't sure how or even where some may be. They're looking for events they could 
            attend to help, or even just the locations of businesses they could go and support. 
        </p>

        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Are there any local events where I can promote my business?</li>
            <li>Where are some local resturants I could go to?</li>
            <li>What demographics should I be cateering to in town?</li>
            <li>How can I make more connections to further my business?</li>
            <li>How can I be more visible in my community?</li>
        </ul>
